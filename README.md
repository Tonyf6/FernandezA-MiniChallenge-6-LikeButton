Mini Challenge 6 - Like Icon
Starting a new project where we are creating a simple React component called "Like"  component that when clicked it toggles fills in the icon on and off 
Person who Peer Reviewed me was Alejandro De La Cruz
Peer Review Comment: code is clean. the like button fills in nicely when clicked and the button design looks just like a bootstrap button. good job Tony!
